## Volunteer Application
Those looking to volunteer for the RFKC can visit the website, login/register, and fill out a form for new or returning volunteers. They can also donate through the link to the donation page. After submitting an application, the user automatically gets added onto a process flow diagram/pipeline where their application progress will be tracked.

## Internal users
Internal users can view the pipelines and click on volunteer users' names to see a list of their applications. Once the volunteer's application is reviewed, the internal user can choose to move them forward on the pipeline or remove them from it. Internal users can also create forms, edit forms, and delete forms.
